**SeBRe (Segmenting Brain Regions) is a high-throughput Mask R-CNN** [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)]-**based toolbox to generate brain atlas through deep learning**.

— __SeBRe demo__:
Run the following notebook to reproduce the results of SeBRe.

— **To train SeBRe on your (custom) dataset**:

__1__. Collect brain sections and place each of them in a separate folder with the following naming convention e.g. 

__2__. Draw ground-truth (binary) masks on Regions of Interest (ROIs) e.g. cortex, hippocampus, etc. using a scalar vector graphics (SVG) software such as Boxy SVG [[2](https://boxy-svg.com/)], RectLabel [[3](https://rectlabel.com/)], Inkscape [[4](https://inkscape.org/)], etc. and assign a unique color code to each ROI. In the figure below, mouse brain section is using before (a) and after (d) annotation by human expert. A zoomed-in examples of cortex (b) and hindbrain (c) are shown to precisely match the boundaries of masks with the corresponding ROIs.

__3__. Run the following notebook to generate the binary (black and white) masks to train SeBRe deep neural network (DNN). The notebook will generate the file names in SeBRe-readable format.

__4__. Run the following notebook to train the SeBRe DNN on your dataset.

__5__. Run the following notebook to test the SeBRe DNN on your dataset.
